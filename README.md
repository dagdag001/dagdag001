## Hi there 👋

I’m Dagim, a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building practical, scalable web applications from idea to deployment. I like working across the entire stack and thinking through how each layer connects, from database structure to backend logic to user experience.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding systems deeply rather than just making them work. I enjoy solving logic problems, debugging complex issues, and improving performance where it matters.

Always learning. Always building.
