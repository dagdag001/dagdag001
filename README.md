## Hi there 👋

I’m Dagim, a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building practical, scalable web applications from idea to deployment. I like working across the entire stack and thinking through how each layer connects, from database structure to backend logic to user experience.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding systems deeply rather than just making them work. I enjoy solving logic problems, debugging complex issues, and improving performance where it matters.

I’m continuously working on strengthening my system design skills, refining architecture decisions, and building production ready projects that reflect real world standards.

Always learning. Always building.
